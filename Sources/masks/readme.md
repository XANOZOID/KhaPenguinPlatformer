# Masks


The majority of this directory has code that came out of the collision logic 
from the HaxePunk repository. It is licensed under MIT - which is different than the 
rest of the code in the root repo.


# Other

The code is only slightly modified so that the collisions are not integrated
directly with Entities, the primary building blocks in HaxePunk, so they
can be used generically.
